Problem: The N queen puzzle
The 8-queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no
two queens cross each other, thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row,
column, or diagonal. The 8-queens puzzle is an example of the more general n-queens puzzel of
placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural
numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3.
